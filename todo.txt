Given the graph with vertices in 3 dimensions, want to project each link / knot
into 2 dimensions so that we can see the over and under crossings of the 
object. 

A first step is to induce an arbitrary orientation on the structure.
To do so, consider the graph to be directed so that the graph has 
exactly a single loop (all edges are coherent). 

A crossing is said to be "right-handed" if it obeys the "right-hand-rule".
Place your hand with thumb in the direction of the over strand. 
Direct your pointer finger in the direction of the unnder strand.
Curl your fingers so that they are perpendicular with the thumb / pointer.
If they go out of the page ('positive') it is right-handed.
Otherwise, it is left-handed.

The projection is arbitrary so long as it is consistent over all loops. 

Idea:
	When projecting down a dimension ("removing the z-direction"),
	note which are closer to 0, or which would hit the page first
	if you were to push the object into a flat object. 

We are trying to "planarize" the loop but we need to know which lines are 
on top and which are on bottom.
